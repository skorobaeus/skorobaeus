# Hi there! üëã

My name is Svetlana. I'm a Full Stack Web Designer. I can develop a visual design from scratch and bring it to life in a browser.

## Currently

I'm currently working on two educational projects:

### [Doka](https://doka.guide/), like MDN but in Russian and with passion
For Doka, I create demos. Demo is a little webpage inbuilt into an article to help to explain it.

My job here is to understand the idea of the article's author and help to transform it into a final webpage. To maintain the visual consistency of demos, I developed a design system covering the common basic elements.

‚úç [Read an article](https://habr.com/ru/company/yandex_praktikum/blog/646001/) on Habr.com about work done by Doka design team (RU).

### [Netology](https://netology.ru/), a digital professions educational center

With Netology, I cooperate as a mentor and a designer for student projects.

I do a code-review (HTML, CSS, JS), support students and help them to manage their tasks.

## I'm interested in

I value my skill set where design and programming skills are mixed together, and I believe it can help in bringing high-quality user interfaces. I‚Äôm looking to collaborate in creating and evolving design systems, UI libraries and other tools.
